          Programmers are well-aware of the health consequences of our screen-obsessed sedentary lifestyles - stiff necks, sore backs. When you're new, no one tells you about the permament bruise you'll have on your forehead from all of the facepalming.

          Seriously. I say things like "Come on, Ruby, why do you have to be such a finnicky *****?!?". (Yes, I speak to Ruby. My penchant for anthropomorphism drives my biologist husband bonkers.) When you are first learning the syntax of a new language, every little thing breaks your code.
        </p>
        <p class="hide">.</p>
        <p>
          These are 10 actual facepalm moments I experienced while learning Ruby. I offer them so that, perhaps, you will not make the same mistakes.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <p class="hide">.</p>
          <li>
            1. Periods have to go inside quotes. You can't have stray punctuation thrown in like confetti.
          </li>

          <li>
            2. Initialize is spelled I-N-I-T-I-A-L-I-Z-E. Ruby won't understand if you spell it any other way - especially if you are really confused and type "initiate" instead.
          </li>

          <li>
            3. When Ruby hits a return inside of a loop, that's it. The loop's done running.
          </li>

          <li>
            4. Methods can't call themselves. Well, they can, but it's called recursion and you should only do it on purpose and with an attainable base case.
          </li>

          <li>
            5. 'Single quotes' don't work for string interpolation nor do they get the job done for escape sequences.
          </li>

          <li>
            6. Require and require relative are different. Do you want to require something like a gem? Or would you like to require relative a file in the same or a nearby directory?
          </li>

          <li>
            7. Else won't take a conditional. Assume anything you haven't covered in an if or elsif conditional will automatically slide into this category.
          </li>

          <li>
            8. If Ruby wants 2 arguements, you give her 2 arguements. There's no negotiating.
          </li>

          <li>
            9. Keep your coverage in your .gitignore. Ain't nobody got time for that kind of scrolling.
          </li>

          <li>
           1<span>0.</span> = and == both have a role to play, and those roles are very different.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Code Like a 5th Grader</h2>

           I didn't type a line of code until I was 28. Sometimes I get sucked into a terrifying narrative that I will never be as good as a programmer that's been doing it their whole life. That's probably true, and can feel defeating. But then I think about 5th graders.

          Most typically-developing 5th graders can write a story with a detailed main character and logical plot. They can read novels and non-fiction with some level of sophistication. They can solve multi-step mathematical story problems. They can contemplate big, underlying questions. They can conduct a small scientific investigation and come to reasonable conclusions about their findings. They can make awesome <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-gQLqv9f4o&list=PLzvRx_johoA-YabI6FWcU-jL6nKA1Um-t&index=94">videos</a>. When you list all of the things a fifth grader <b>can</b> do, instead of focusing on what they haven't learned yet, they are pretty impressive.

          What does this have to do with learning to code as an adult?
          Are 5th graders experts with an excess of skills? Nope. Do they still have growing competencies and cool things to contribute? Absolutely. Am I a programming expert with an excess of skills? Nope. Do I still have growing competencies and cool things to contribute? Absolutely. This is easy to forget.

          <p>
          It's incredibly humbling to start learning a completely new skill as an adult. It's also really hard. When I taught elementary school, there were broad goals we wanted for our 5th graders - Do they have a foundation of fundamental skills? Do they know how to look something up independently? Can they work with others? Do they love learning?
          </p>

          <p>
          What if instead of worrying about "catching up" and being the best, we hold ourselves as a novice programmers to these same standards?

        <h3>Week 1: Calculator</h3>
        <p class="hide">.</p>
        <p>
          We wrote <a href= "https://gist.github.com/Erin007/1624c6ad4159d641c672dc6d2add4067">calculator programs</a> that could add, multiply, subtract and divide two numbers. Okay, so it's no T1-89, but it sure felt like a jump from the "Hello World" program I had only recently mastered. This project was the first where I...

        <ul>
          <li>dealt with error handling for user input (albeit in a rudimentary way)</li>
          <li>refactored a long, long list of if statements into a more readable case statement</li>
          <li>used an unless loop to let a user continue "playing"</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="hide">.</p>
        <p>
           After meeting the <a href="https://github.com/AdaGold/standalone-exercises/blob/master/calculator.md"> baseline requirements</a>, I wrote a little <a href= "https://gist.github.com/Erin007/edd3e7f3cb2cd392eb6428f57a826776">code that found factors</a> of numbers, including negatives and identified prime numbers.

        <h3>Week 2: Solar System</h3>
        <p class="hide">.</p>
        <p>
          This week was a meteor shower of new information. We worked on a <a href= "https://github.com/Ada-C6/Solar-System">planetary project</a> wherein we created objects in a planet class that have a variety  of attributes. We completed the project in two waves...

          <p class="hide">.</p>

          <p>I also tackled some optional enhancements such as calculating the distance between two planets using their distance from the sun attributes. It was out of this world! Through completing this project, I finally understand why everyone keeps harping on the idea that "everything is an object" in Ruby.

        <h3>Week 3: Bank Accounts</h3>
        <p class="hide">.</p>
        <p>
          Using a Bank module, we created various classes for different aspects of bank accounts. The <a href="https://github.com/Ada-C6/BankAccounts"> assignment </a>started out straightforaward enough, until objects of different classes had to associate with one another based on shared attributes. Whoa. Takeaways:
        </p>
        <p class="hide">.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
           Class inheritance saves you from repetition. It's super!
         </li>
          <li>
            I figured out how to raise Exceptions with useful messages. Don't even think about opening that Money Market account with less than $10,000.
         </li>
          <li>
            sprintf "%.2f" is a beautiful little snippet of code
          </li>
          <p class="hide">.</p>

            You can take a peak at the<a href="https://github.com/Erin007/BankAccounts/blob/master/Erin_bank_account_w3.rb"> final code here</a>, and see my first ever class methods and read of info from a csv. Adios, gets.chomp. You can also see the comment relics of my first great "end" scavenger hunt. I'm totally ready to make secure accounts for a real bank, right?

        <h3>Week 5: Farmers' Markets</h3>
        <p class="hide">.</p>
        <p>
          The previous cohorts warned us it was coming - the elusive "Far Mar". OMG get ready for CSVs and TDD! Realistically,<a href="https://github.com/Ada-C6/FarMar"> the assignment</a> was managable. It was an opportunity to put together all of the individual Ruby concepts we'd studied. Here's my advice for future FarMar folks:
        </p>
        <p class="hide">.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make a diagram ahead of time for how to you expect your classes to interact with one another and make sure you're crystal clear about what type of object a method should return.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make some tea while you wait. Reading in from a CSV with thousands of lines is a time intensive process. If you don't optimize it, your tests take forever.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make your tests print out something every time a loop runs to let you know if your test is actually running. Emojis work best.
        </li>
        <p class="hide">.</p>
        <p>
          My whole <a href="https://github.com/Erin007/FarMar">FarMar project</a> could use some refactoring.  If the goal is DRY code, there was a rainstorm at my Farmer's Market. But, alas, it has the baseline functionality and a slew of optional requirements.

          <h3>Weeks 11 & 12: Petsy</h3>
          <p class="hide">.</p>
          <p>
            Petsy was a beast of a project, and not just because we chose to make ours about animals. As a group of 3 people, we spent the last two weeks making a mock e-commerce site loosely based on Etsy. This was the largest project with the most ambiguous  <a href="https://github.com/Ada-C6/betsy">guidelines</a> so far, and we had to tackle deeply philosophical questions:
          </p>
          <p class="hide">.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              What is a cart? What type of users can have a cart? If there are different types of users, are they different models or the same model with different attributes? How can a cart and its contents persist across sessions? What is a cookie?
            </li>
            <li>
              How do you resolve a merge conflict? Can we still be friends if all of the validations I just wrote broke everything you've worked on for three days? What is a join table? How do I use Trello? Does KanBan know?
            </li>
            <li>
              How can users log in securely via a third party site? How magical is Rails? Will we actaully finish this project?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="hide">.</p>
          <p>
            The final <a href="https://petsy-app.herokuapp.com/">site</a> is pretty snazzy and even features a Ryan Gosling cameo. Plus, it's chockfull of groan-worthy animal puns - always an important feature.

          <h3>Weeks 15 - 17: JavaScript</h3>
          <p class="hide">.</p>
          <p>
            One of our instructors referred to JavaScript as a "hot garbage pile of a language", apparently because it was created in just 10 days and has a large number of quirks (sorry, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">Brendan Eich</a>!). I, however, think it's brillant. This hot garbage pile of a language makes sense to my tangled mess of a brain. Checkout some cool mini-projects I made as we learned the basics of JS, JQuery and Backbone:

          <p>
            You can play a little tune on a <a href="js-music-keyboard/index.html">keyboard</a>, book a fake trip with an API-integrated travel app, or add a contact to a rolodex.

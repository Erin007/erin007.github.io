        <h3>Week 1: Calculator</h3>
        <p>
          We wrote <a href= "https://gist.github.com/Erin007/1624c6ad4159d641c672dc6d2add4067">calculator programs</a> that could add, multiply, subtract and divide two numbers. Okay, so it's no T1-89, but it sure felt like a jump from the "Hello World" program I had only recently mastered. This project was the first where I...

        <p><em>•</em> dealt with error handling for user input (albeit in a rudimentary way)</p>

        <p><em>•</em>  refactored a long, long list of if statements into a more readable case statement</p>

        <p><em>•</em> used an unless loop to let a user continue "playing"</p>

        <p>
           After meeting the <a href="https://github.com/AdaGold/standalone-exercises/blob/master/calculator.md"> baseline requirements</a>, I wrote a little <a href= "https://gist.github.com/Erin007/edd3e7f3cb2cd392eb6428f57a826776">code that found factors</a> of numbers, including negatives and identified prime numbers.

        <h3>Week 2: Solar System</h3>
        <p>
          This week was a meteor shower of new information. We worked on a <a href= "https://github.com/Ada-C6/Solar-System">planetary project</a> wherein we created objects in a planet class that have a variety  of attributes. We completed the project in two waves...

              <em>•</em><a href= "https://gist.github.com/Erin007/177ca08a0b31b971f19d630e82897f48"> Wave 1</a>: was the first time I used classes, and initialized new objects
          </p>
          <p>
              <em>•</em><a href="https://gist.github.com/Erin007/789979ea5083fab86003dc953a5341ad"> Wave 2</a>: stepped it up a notch by asking us to use an array of planets to initialize a solar system object of a new class
          </p>
          <p>
              <em>•</em> I also tackled some optional enhancements such as calculating the distance between two planets using their distance from the sun attributes. It was out of this world!
          </p>
          <p>
            Through completing this project, I finally understand why everyone keeps harping on the idea that "everything is an object" in Ruby.

        <h3>Week 3: Bank Accounts</h3>
        <p>
          Using a Bank module, we created various classes for different aspects of bank accounts. The <a href="https://github.com/Ada-C6/BankAccounts"> assignment </a>started out straightforaward enough, until objects of different classes had to associate with one another based on shared attributes. Whoa. Takeaways:

          <p>
              <em>•</em> Class inheritance saves you from repetition. It's super!
          </p>
          <p>
              <em>•</em> I figured out how to raise Exceptions with useful messages. Don't even think about opening that Money Market account with less than $10,000.
          </p>
          <p>
              <em>•</em> sprintf "%.2f" is a beautiful little snippet of code
          </p>
          <p>
            You can take a peak at the<a href="https://github.com/Erin007/BankAccounts/blob/master/Erin_bank_account_w3.rb"> final code here</a>, and see my first ever class methods and read of info from a csv. Adios, gets.chomp. You can also see the comment relics of my first great "end" scavenger hunt. I'm totally ready to make secure accounts for a real bank, right?

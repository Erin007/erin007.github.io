         I didn't type a line of code until I was 28. Sometimes I get sucked into a terrifying narrative that I will never be as good as a programmer that's been doing it their whole life.

          Programmers are well-aware of the health consequences of our screen-obsessed sedentary lifestyles - stiff necks, sore backs.

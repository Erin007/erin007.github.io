            Ruby is rather beginner-friendly. Rubyists are notoriously helpful - thanks in part to the tone Matsumoto set when he wrote the language. As such, there is a plethora of high-quality, readable resources available to even a total Ruby Newbie such as myself. <a href = "blog-posts/ruby-resources.html">Read more...</a>

           I didn't type a line of code until I was 28. Sometimes I get sucked into a terrifying narrative that I will never be as good as a programmer that's been doing it their whole life. That's probably true. But then I think about 5th graders. <a href ="blog-posts/code-like-a-5th-grader.html"> Read more...</a>

          As a teacher and especially as a private learning specialist, I was often asked "What do you think about technology in education?" Not surprisingly, I have strong thoughts on the topic. I don't like this question, and some of you aren't going to like my answer. <a href = "blog-posts/edtech.html">Read more...</a>

          Programmers are well-aware of the health consequences of our screen-obsessed sedentary lifestyles - stiff necks, sore backs. What no one tells you about when you're new is the permament bruise you'll have on your forehead from all of the facepalming. <a href ="blog-posts/troubleshooting-101.html">Read more...</a>

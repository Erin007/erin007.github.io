    There's a nagging idea that I will never be as good at it as someone who's been doing it their whole life.

    I used to teach elementary school, and I keep thinking back to the goals we wanted for our 5th graders - Do they have a foundation of fundamental skills? Do they know how to look something up independently? Can they work with others? Do they love learning? I think I can code at a 5th grade reading level.

    But, I don't have to be the best. I'm a literate native English speaker. I don't have a Pulitzer Prize.

      It's incredibly humbling to start learning a completely new skill as an adult.
